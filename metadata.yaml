name: prometheus-edge-hub
description: |
  Prometheus Edge Hub is a replacement of the Prometheus Pushgateway which allows for the pushing of
  metrics to an endpoint for scraping by prometheus, rather than having Prometheus scrape the metric
  sources directly. This differs from the Prometheus Pushgateway in several ways, the most important
  of which being that it does not overwrite timestamps and that metrics do not persist until updated.
  When the hub is scraped, all metrics are drained.
